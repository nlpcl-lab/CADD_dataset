Problem is I sometimes need my hand to get hard and it often just points straight out sort of at a 90 degree angle as opposed to up. It points slightly up sometimes but not regularly.  I can also 'tense/flex' my penis and lift it up at a higher angle with muscular control. Does this mean I'm not fully erect and only at 70-80%? Thanks!",

        "comment": "There's a few reasons why people have negative reactions. The first is that a lot of people associate feet with being dirty and nasty. A lot of people find feet gross- similar to how a lot of people feel about piss/scat fetishes. The reason why a lot of women find guys with a foot fetish creepy is because men online can be really fucking creepy with pushing their fetishes on women who want nothing to do with it- and feet is one of the biggest ones.",

Half the season Louis is the selfish arsehole who we all hate, then he learns his lesson and steps up for the firm and we love him. It'd take an entire season of him behaving for me to be impressed with him.  I don't think the writers deserve the credit as much as the actor. Being able to play a character who's constantly flip flopping is impressive. That's more of a credit to the actor than the writers.",

You can give a BJ touching only the tip of his dick (this will drive him insane, he'll want to DIVE deep into your mouth, so it's advised to have him restrained) Edit: oh and you can purr with his dick in your throat, if you can handle it",

I just don't understand, given Coronavirus, how the production quality has gone down so much. I guess I'm an LEC fan now, which is fine cause Froskurinn is currently my favorite caster",

Smotrich, Peretz) see the West Bank as part of the Biblical Land of Israel which is promised to them by God.",
