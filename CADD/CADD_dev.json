So if you have a short turnover between becoming aroused and ejaculating, you tend to get a smaller amount of more concentrated semen with a thick, glue-like consistency. But if you slow down and take your time, your body has enough time to dilute it down, resulting in a bigger and more fluid load.",

Practice with it a couple times a day.  The goal is to desensitize your throat and get it used to feeling something in there.  Also, lean your head back, just like a sword swallower.  When you try it with him, do a position with your head tilted back, like  69, with so on top to control.  Best of luck.",
